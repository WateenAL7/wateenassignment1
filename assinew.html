    <h4> Project 2 : 4 Bit Binary synchronous counter </h4>
    <p>This project aims to design a 4-bit synchronous binary counter using T Flip-Flops. It is used in digital systems for event counting or time interval generation. The project utilizes simulation software like Tinkercad and Logisim, with inputs controlled by DIP switches and outputs displayed through LEDs. It includes defining input equations for each Flip-Flop, designing the circuit, and implementing it using a 7473 IC.</p>
